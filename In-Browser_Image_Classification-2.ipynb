Next, you'll want to start a HTTP Server on your local machine (if you simply open index.html in a browser, you may run into security protections that prevent it from loading scripts. To start a server, you can use one built-in to Python.

Now, open a browser (point the URL to `localhost:8888`). Your webpage should appear. To debug, in Chrome you can open the Javascript console via ```View - Developer -> Developer tools -> Console```.
